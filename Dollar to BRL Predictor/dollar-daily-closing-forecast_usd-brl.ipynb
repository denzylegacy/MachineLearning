This allows the model to adapt to the data and make more accurate predictions. The main advantage of BayesianRidge is its ability to handle multicollinearity, which is the correlation between predictors. Furthermore, BayesianRidge is a regularized model that can handle regression problems where there are few samples and many predictors.\n","\n","The API used for this project is provided by [AwesomeAPI](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-23T22:28:15.954572Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-23T22:28:15.954097Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.031712Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.030406Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-23T22:28:15.954504Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# import from core libraries\n","import requests\n","import json\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import datetime\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.034897Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.034189Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.123864Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.122593Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.034855Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# model import\n","from sklearn import linear_model\n","bayesian_ridge = linear_model.BayesianRidge()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.125973Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.125563Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.131360Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.130186Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-23T22:28:17.125939Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# timestamp conversion function\n","def convert_timestamp(timestamp):\n","    dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp)\n","    return dt.strftime(\"%m/%d/%Y\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-23T22:30:24.758113Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-23T22:30:24.757684Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-23T22:30:24.981678Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-23T22:30:24.980159Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-23T22:30:24.758076Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{'USDBRL': {'code': 'USD', 'codein': 'BRL', 'name': 'DÃ³lar Americano/Real Brasileiro', 'high': '5.0493', 'low': '5.0493', 'varBid': '0.0008', 'pctChange': '0.01', 'bid': '5.0486', 'ask': '5.0501', 'timestamp': '1682110792', 'create_date': '2023-04-21 17:59:52'}}\n","5.0486\n"]}],"source":["# getting the connection to the API.
